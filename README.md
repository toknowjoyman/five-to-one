# Five-to-0ne
An app to implement the Warren Buffet &amp; Charles Munger 5/25 rule into a todo app, s.t. we <i> "gonna make it, baby, in our prime". </i>

The 5/25 rule by WBCM allows you to focus your thoughts and acheive success in your goals instead of <i>"Trade in your hours for a handful dimes". </i>

With a name inspired by the Doors song the App is meant to assist people to take back control of thier lives. We no longer need to hear another human complain: 
<i> "Shadows of the evening crawl across the years, Ya walk across the floor with a flower in your hand, Trying to tell me no one understands" </i>



# Lyrics of the song for reference and inspiration
<i> Five to one, baby
One in five
No one here gets out alive, now
You get yours, baby
I'll get mine
Gonna make it, baby
If we try

<i>The old get old
And the young get stronger
May take a week
And it may take longer
They got the guns
But we got the numbers
Gonna win, yeah
We're takin' over
Come on!

<i>Your ballroom days are over, baby
Night is drawing near
Shadows of the evening crawl across the years
Ya walk across the floor with a flower in your hand
Trying to tell me no one understands
Trade in your hours for a handful dimes
Gonna' make it, baby, in our prime
